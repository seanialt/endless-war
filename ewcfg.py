It does it's job well and only occasionally bursts into flames."

They could lead to anywhere. So close, and yet so mysterious."

With limited amounts of graffiti sprayed unto the otherwise sort-of white walls, there's actually some semblance of visual simplicity. For once in this city, your eyes aren't being completely assaulted with information or blinding lights. Boring, this place sucks. Board whatever train you're getting on and get back to killing people as soon as possible."

It's by far the filthiest subway line in the city, which is exponentially worsened by it's bizarre, unexplainable faux wood paneling that lines every train. You can only imagine that this design decision was made to make the subway feel less sterile and more homely, but the constant stench of piss and homeless people puking sort of ruins that idea. Riding the Yellow Line makes you feel like you're at your grandma's house every single time you ride it, if your grandma's house was in Jaywalker Plain."

By far the worst subway line, the Yellow Line can't keep it's terrible interior design choices contained to its actual trains. Even in its terminals, the faux wood paneling clashes with every other aesthetic element present. It's ghastly ceilings have turned a delightful piss-soaked shade of faded white. It's bizarre mixture of homely decorations and completely dilapidated state makes you oddly beguiled in a way. How did they fuck up the Yellow Line so bad? The world may never know."

# Dict of all help responses linked to their associated topics
help_responses = {
	"gangs":"**Gang Violence** is the center focus of **Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers' ENDLESS WAR**. Enlisting in a gang allows you to attack other gang members, juveniles, and ghosts with the **'!kill'** command. To enlist in a gang, head to a gang base (Rowdy Roughhouse for the ROWDYS, Copkilltown for the KILLERS) and use **'!enlist'**, provided you also have at least 50,000 slime on hand. This will permanently affiliate you with that gang, unless you are !pardon'd by the **ROWDY FUCKER** (Munchy), or the **COP KILLER** (Ben Saint). You may use **'!renounce'** in a gang base to return to the life of a juvenile, but you will still be affiliated with that gang, thus disallowing you from entering the enemy's gang base. Additionally, a Kingpin, should they feel the need to, can inflict the '!banned' status upon you, preventing you from enlisting.",
	"mining":"Mining is the primary way to gain slime in **ENDLESS WAR**. When you type one **'!mine'** command, you raise your hunger by about 0.5%. The more slime you mine for, the higher your level gets, and the higher your level gets, the more slime you gain with every '!mine' command, resulting in exponential gains. Mining will sometimes endow you with hardened crystals of slime called **slime poudrins**, which can be used for farming and annointing your weapon. **JUVENILES** can mine any time they like, but **ROWDYS** and **KILLERS** are restricted to mining during the day (8AM-6PM) and night (8PM-6AM), respectively.",
	"food":"Food lowers your hunger by a set amount, and can be ordered from various **restaurants** within the city. Generally speaking, the more expensive food is, the more hunger it sates. You can **'!order'** food and eat it at the same time, or add **'togo'** (or just 't') at the end of your order to place it in your inventory (example: !order pizza togo). Ordering it togo **doubles** the price, however, and you can only carry a certain amount of food depending on your level. Regular food items expire after 2 in-game days, or 12 hours in real life, while crops expire after 8 in-game days (48 hours), and food items gained from milling expire after a whole 2 weeks in real life. Three popular restauraunts close by various gang bases include **THE SPEAKEASY** (juveniles), **THE SMOKER'S COUGH** (rowdys), and **RED MOBSTER SEAFOOD** (killers), though there are other places to order food as well, such as the **Food Court**.",
	"capturing":"Capturing districts is the primary objective of **ENDLESS WAR**. If you reach **level 10** (done by gaining at least 10,000 slime), you are able to capture districts and generate slime for your team's **Kingpin**. The rate at which you capture a district is determined by various factors. If more **people** are capturing a district, that district will take **less** time to capture. The **property class** (which can range from S at the highest to C at the lowest) of that district will also increase capture time, with S class districts taking more time to capture than C class districts. Districts will take **less** time to capture if they are nearby **friendly** districts, and **more** time to capture if they are nearby **enemy** districts. Districts will have their capture progress **decay** over time, but if a captured district is **fully surrounded** by friendly districts (example: Assault Flats Beach is surrounded by Vagrant's Corner and New New Yonkers), then it will **not** decay. Inversely, districts will decay **faster** if they are next to **enemy** districts. **DECAPTURING** (lowering an enemy's capture progress on districts they control) and **RENEWING** (increasing capture progress on districts your team currently controls) can also be done, but only if that district is **not** fully surrounded. **JUVIE'S ROW**, **ROWDY ROUGHHOUSE**, and **COP KILLTOWN** are gang bases, and thus cannot be captured, nor do they decay. To check the capture progress of a district, use **'!progress'**. To view the status of the map itself and check what property class each district has, use **'!map'**.",
	"transportation": "There are various methods of transportation within the city, the quickest and most efficient of them being **The Subway System**. Trains can be boarded with **'!board'** or **'!embark'**, and to board specific trains, you can add your destination to the command. For example, to board the red line to Cratersville, you would use '!board redtocv'. **'!disembark'** can be used to exit a train. **The Ferry** (which moves between Vagrant's Corner and Wreckington) and **The Blimp** (which moves between Dreadford and Assault Flats Beach) can also be used as methods of transportation, though they take longer to arrive at their destinations than the trains do. Refer to the diagram below (credits to Connor#3355) on understanding which districts have subway stations on them, though take note that the white subway line is currently non-operational.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431238867459375145/570392908780404746/t_system_final_stop_telling_me_its_wrong_magicks.png",
	"death":"Death is an integral mechanic to Endless War. Even the most experienced players will face the sewers every now and again. If you find yourself in such a situation, use **'!revive'**, and you will return to the land of the living as a juvenile. Try not to die too often however, as using !revive collects a 'death tax', which is 1/10th of your current slimecoin. Alternatively, you can hold off on reviving and remain a **ghost**, which has its own gameplay mechanics associated with it. To learn more, use '!help ghosts' at one of the colleges.",
	"dojo":"**The Dojo** is where you acquire weapons to fight and kill other players with. To purchase a weapon, use **'!arm [weapon]'**. There are many weapons you can choose from, and they all perform differently from one another. Once you've purchased a weapon, you can use **'!equip [weapon]'** to equip it, provided that you're enlisted in a gang beforehand. You can also name your weapon by spending a poudrin on it with **'!annoint [name]'**. Furthermore, annointing will increase your mastery over that weapon, but it's much more efficient to do so through **sparring**. To learn more about the sparring system and weapon ranks, use !help sparring.",
	"scavenging":"Scavenging allows you to collect slime that is **stored** in districts. When someone in a district gets hurt or dies, their slime **splatters** onto the ground, allowing you to use **'!scavenge'** and collect it, similarly to mining. Scavenging, however, raises your hunger by about 0.8% per use of the '!scavenge' command, so it's often more efficient to do a '!scavenge' command **every 30 seconds** or so, resulting in the highest potential collection of slime at the lowest cost of hunger. You can still spam it, just as you would with '!mine', but you'll gain less and less slime if you don't wait for the 30 second cool-down. To check how much slime you can scavenge, use **'!look'** while in a district channel.",
	"farming":"**Farming** is an alternative way to gain slime, accessible only by **JUVENILES**. It is done by planting poudrins on a farm with the **'!sow'** command. You can only '!sow' one poudrin per farm. After about 12 in-game hours (3 hours in real life), you can use **'!reap'** to gain 300,000 slime, with a 1/3 chance to gain a poudrin. If you do gain a poudrin, you also have 1/3 chance to gain a second poudrin. If your poudrin plant is left alone for too long (around 2 in-game days, or 12 hours in real life), it will **die out**. In addition to slime, farming also provides you with various **crops** which can be used for **milling**. Crops can be eaten by themselves, but it's much more useful if you use **'!mill'** on them while at a farm, granting you **dyes**, as well as food items and cosmetics associated with that crop, all at the cost of 75,000 slime per '!mill'. Dyes can be used on slimeoids with **'!saturateslimeoid'**. Current farms within the city include **JUVIE'S ROW FARMS** (within Juvie's Row), **OOZE GARDENS FARMS** (close by Rowdy Roughhouse), and **ARSONBROOK FARMS** (close by Cop Killtown).",
	"slimeoids":"**SLIMEOIDS** are sentient masses of slime that you can keep as **pets**. To learn how to make one for yourself, visit **The Slimeoid Laboratory** in Brawlden and check the enclosed **'!instructions'**. After you've made one, you can also battle it out with other slimeoids in **The Arena**, located in Vandal Park. Slimeoids can also be used to fight off **negaslimeoids** that have been summoned by ghosts, though be warned, as this is a fight to the death! In regards to your slimeoid's stats, a slimeoid's **'Moxie'** represents its physical attack, **'Chutzpah'** its special attack, and **'Grit'** its defense. Additionally, the color you dye your slimeoid with **'!saturateslimeoid'** also plays into combat. Your slimeoid gets attack bonuses against slimeoids that have its split complementary hue and resist slimeoids with its analgous hues. For more information, see the diagrams linked below (credits to Connor#3355). There are also various commands you can perform on your slimeoid, such as **'!observeslimeoid'**, **'!petslimeoid'**, **'!walkslimeoid'**, and **'!playfetch'**. To humanely and ethically euthanize your slimeoid, use **'!dissolveslimeoid'** at the laboratory.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492088204053184533/586310921274523648/SLIMEOID-HUE.png\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/177891183173959680/586662087653064706/SLIMEOID-HUE.gif\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/177891183173959680/586662095848996894/SLIMEOID_HUE_NOTE.png",
	"ghosts":"Ghosts can perform an action known as **haunting**. Every use of **'!haunt'** takes up 0.2% of the slime of whoever was haunted (you may also add a customized message by doing '!haunt [message]'). It can be done face-to-face like with !kill, or done remotely at the sewers. As a ghost, you can only move within a small radius around the area at which you died. Furthermore, if a player has consumed **coleslaw**, they can **'!bust'** ghosts, which sends them back to the sewers and removes 1/10th of the ghost's **negative slime**. Negative slime is gained through haunting, and allows ghosts to summon **negaslimoids** in the city, with the use of **'!summon [ammount]'**. Negaslimeoids haunt all players within a district, and also decay capture progress.",
	"scouting":"Scouting is a way for you to check how many **players** might be in a district that's close by. You can do just **'!scout'** to check the district you're already in, or **'!scout [district]'** to scout out that specific district. For example, if you were in Vagrant's Corner, you could use '!scout gld' to see how many players might be in Green Light District. Scouting will show both **friendly and enemy** gang members, as well as juveniles and even ghosts. Scouting will list all players above your own level, as well as players below your level, but at a certain **cutoff point**. If you can't scout someone, it's safe to assume they have around **1/10th** the amount of slime that you do, or less. It should be noted that scouting currently only gives an estimate, sending off different messages depending on how many players are in that district. See the diagram below for more information.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/441726245923717129/587337001234333737/scouting.png",
	"cosmetics":"**Cosmetics** are items that the player may wear. To equip or un-equip a cosmetic, use **'!adorn [cosmetic]'**. If you have three slime poudrins, you can use **'!smelt'** to create a new one from scratch. Cosmetics can also be obtained from milling vegetables at farms. Cosmetics can either be of 'plebian' or 'patrician' quality, indicating their rarity. If you win an art contest held for the community, you can also ask a Kingpin to make a **soulbound** cosmetic for you, which is custom tailored to your desires, and will not leave your inventory upon death.",
	"sparring":"**Sparring** can be done between two players using **'!spar [player]'**. Sparring, provided that both players spar with the same weapon type and are not at full hunger, will increase both of your mastery **LEVEL**, which is a hidden value, by one. The publicly displayed value, mastery **RANK** (which is just your mastery level minus 4), is more important. It should be noted that the damage you deal with your weapon is increased even if you haven't reached rank 1 yet. However, once you do reach mastery rank 1 (Again, this would be level 5), when you next revive, you will now **permanently** be at level 3 for that weapon type. Essentially, this means you would only have to '!spar' or '!annoint' twice to get back up to rank 1. Once you reach **rank 6**, you can no longer annoint your weapon rank any higher, and must instead kill other players (that are higher in slime level than you) to do so. Reaching rank 6 also stops you from increasing your own rank through sparring, unless you are sparring with someone who has a higher weapon rank than you. You can only spar up to someone else's mastery rank, minus 1 (example: Sparring with a rank 15 master of the katana would, at most, allow you to get to rank 14). Sparring has a five minute cooldown and raises your hunger by about 15%, so make sure to bring some food with you beforehand. Once you reach rank 8, you may also **'!marry'** your weapon, resulting in a matrimonial ceremony that increases your rank by two.",
	"bleeding":"When you get hit by someone using a '!kill' command, certain things happen to your slime. Let's say you take 20,000 points of damage. **50%** of that slime, in this case 10,000, immediately becomes scavengeable. However, the other 50%, provided that you didn't die instantly, will undergo the **bleeding** process. 25% of that slime, in this case 5,000, is immediately added to a 'bleed pool', causing it to slowly trickle out of your body and onto the ground for it to be scavenged. The remaining 25% of that slime will **slowly** be added to the 'bleed pool', where it will then bleed, just as previously stated. Upon dying, your 'bleed pool' is immediately dumped onto the ground, ready to be scavenged. Think of it like the 'rolling HP' system from the game *EarthBound*. When you get hit, you don't take all your damage upfront, it instead slowly trickles down.",
	"stocks":"**The Stock Exchange** is a sub-zone within downtown NLACakaNM, open only during the daytime. It allows players to **'!invest'** in various **'!stocks'**, which not only affects their own personal monetary gains, but the city's economy as well. Stocks will shift up and down value, which affects the price of food associated with the food chains of those respective stocks. The rate of exchange for stocks can be checked with **'!rates'**, and to withdraw your **'!shares'** from a stock, use **'!withdraw [amount] [stock]'** (the same logic also applies to !invest). Additionally, players may **'!transfer'** their slimecoin to other players at any time of the day while in the stock exchange, but at the cost of a 5% broker's fee and a 20 minute cooldown on subsequent transfers.",
	"casino":"**The Casino** is a sub-zone in Green Light District where players may bet their slime coin in various games, including **'!slimepachinko'**, **'!slimecraps'**, **'!slimeslots'**, **'!slimeroulette'**, and **'!slimebaccarat'**. Some games allow you to bet certain amounts, while other games have a fixed cost. Furthermore, the casino allows you to challenge other players to a game of **'!russianroulette'**, where all of the loser's slime is transferred to the winner.",
	"offline":"Given that ENDLESS WAR is a **Discord** game, there are a few peculiarities surrounding it and how it interacts with Discord itself. When you set your status to **'Offline'**, you can still move between districts if you typed a '!goto' command beforehand. You won't show up on the sidebar in that district's channel, but people can still scout for you, and see the '[player] has entered [district]' message when you do enter the district they're in. Furthermore, you **can't** use commands while offline, and can only use commands **10 seconds** after coming online again. Often times, you may find yourself using '!scout' or '!look' on a district, only to find that **no one** is there besides yourself. This is likely because they're in that district, just with their status set to offline."
